        <h4>Teacher</h4>
        <p>Now, don't be alarmed. Teaching here involves helping your mentee(s) think using the
        best methods. Helping them study efficiently, how to manage their time, how
        to look up resources when they are in dire need.</p>

        <h4>Agent</h4>
        <p>A mentor should be able to stand for his mentee(s). Vouching for them in technical situations,
        and them removing every possible obstacle that could be in their way. After the mentee has made
        a convincing attempt, of course.</p>

        <h4>Role Model</h4>
        <p>Remember, that your mentee looks up to you. That is why you should first of become
        someone who will likely impact others. Have something you would want to see in another person.</p>

        <h4>Confidante</h4>
        <p>First and foremost, your mentee(s) sees you as a friend. They trust you, and may or may not
        tell you things that are geared towards academics all the time. It is your duty to counsel them if they
        have any issue that may be hindering their success rate.</p>
