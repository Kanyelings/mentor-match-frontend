            <h4>Eagerness to learn</h4>
            <p>Everything starts with how eager you are to learn. You
            must show how much knowledge you want to acquire. Set goals, strive to meet them,
            and let your mentor stand ahead to guide you.</p>


        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Patience</h4>
            <p>Exercising patience is key. While it's good to ask questions, your mentor might not
            be able to give you an immediate reply. Remember that it's a peer mentorship
            program, and that everyone gets caught up sometimes.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Optimism</h4>
            <p>Having faith in yourself can make you. But success only comes with hard work and
            positive thinking. While you search for purpose, keep a positive attitude, have faith
            in yourself and your mentor.</p>
